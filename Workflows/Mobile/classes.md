# Classes
Every [Modal](/Modals/) corresponds to a class in the mobile Part. The modals and classes have exactly same attributes. However, to maintain simplicity during the development process, we have implemented toJson and fromJson functions to classes.

toJson and fromJson functions basically takes paramaterized data and converts it to json or takes a json and converts it to parameterized data (Maps).

We use them while we are sending requests or taking request's data.
