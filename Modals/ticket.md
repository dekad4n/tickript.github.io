# Ticket Modal
Ticket modal is created to see if the ticket is checked but not used before. This is created because one could use a ticket many times before a event checker sent the ticket used information to chain.

It has 2 fields:

## tokenId
tokenId is a required Number field, and generated by chain. After the tokenId generated by chain, we use that tokenId to feed this data. TokenIds are generated in minting process.

## controllerAddress
controllerAddress is a required string field. It shows who controlled the ticket. We have created this field to erase data with 1 query.
