# Introduction to Modals
Our modals are what we use in our Mongodb Atlas Database. We have created them with mongoose, however, in this section we will just describe what modals' variables are.

When we are inserting, deleting, updating a field in Mongodb, we always use modals. Therefore, they are important to understand.
