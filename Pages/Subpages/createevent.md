# Create Event Page
Create Event Page is where whitelisted users can create their events. Since the page is basically a form, we can list its inputs as:
- Image 
- Title
- Category
- Start & End Date
- Start & End Time
- Description.

The upload button opens user's documents to upload an image. On the other hand, category dropdown shows all categories that exist in Tickript.

After filling all these inputs, one can create event with confirm button.

An Create Event Page looks like:
