# My Tickets Page
My tickets page has 2 main parts: tickets you own currently and tickets you are selling. However, in the tickets you own currently you may see the tickets that are in auction right now. 

In the tickets you own part, you can click tickets and see a pop-up in which there is a button which redirects to [QR Code Page](/Pages/Subpages/qrcodepage.md). Also from this pop-up you can transfer your ticket, resell it and put it into auction. To see how they work, look at [Usage](/Usage).

In the tickets you are selling part, we see your tickets that are on sale. If you click one of them, you can stop it from selling it. If you stop sale all, you can stop saling of all.

Without popup, my tickets page looks like:
