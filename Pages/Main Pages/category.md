# Category Page
Category pages are accessible through [Home Page](/Pages/Main;with&#32;Pages/home.md). With compared to other Main Pages, they are pretty simple. In a category page, there are title of the category, banner of the category and events under that category. Events are visible through horizontal event cards and when clicked redirects you to [Event Page](/Pages/Main;with32&#;Pages/event.md).

A Category Page looks like:
