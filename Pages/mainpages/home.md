# Home Page

Home page is default screen of Tickript. The log-in state does not affect what home page looks like. It can be accessed by clicking bottom navigation bar's first icon. The home page looks like:
<br/> <br/>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sadigulbey/tickript.github.io/main/static/pages/home.png" style="height:500px;"></img>

The usage of home page is pretty simple. It has two parts:
- Categories
- Events

## Categories
Categories part of the home page has a horizontal slider which shows all the categories of Tickript. There is 6 categories and all of them are clickable. If one goes that category's page, the one will be able to see tickets under that category.

## Events
Events part of the home page is an vertical slider which shows some of the events that are created in Tickript. The vertical slider does not show all the events that exists in Tickript.
