# Introduction to Pages
In pages section, one will see every page of Tickript. The documents will explain what is the page's aim in this section. If you are more interested in how the program works, see [Workflows](/Workflows/introduction.md).

The pages section will have two parts:
- Main Pages
- Subpages

In main pages, the documents explains the pages that is reachable from almost everywhere, however in the subpages one can see deeper pages to gain information about every page.

Our main aim to provide pages section is to give every user an opportunity to meet with Tickript.
