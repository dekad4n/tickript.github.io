The documents will explain what is the page's aim in this section. If you are more interested in how the program works, see Workflows.","The pages section will have two parts:","Main Pages","Subpages","In main pages, the documents explains the pages that is reachable from almost everywhere, however in the subpages one can see deeper pages to gain information about every page.","Our main aim to provide pages section is to give every user an opportunity to meet with Tickript."]}],[{"l":"Event Page","p":["Event page is an input-specific page. Therefore, it needs to be accessed through several ways:","With horizontal event card","With vertical event card","These event cards can be found in Home, Profile or in search section.","Event page is fed from event modal. To see what event modal looks like, see Event Modal.","Events are created with event creation process. Therefore, the event page is formed from actually event owner's inputs.","Event page has three forms: an ordinary user's view, checker's view, event owner's view. Ownership is automatically detected via states of mobile application, therefore the two forms are located in the same page.","An ordinary event page starts with picture of the event and title of it. They are located in the beginning of the page. The owner, the date and the description of the event follows the first part. These are all constant parts that does not change if an user is ordinary or event owner.","Then, there is a table in which minted tickets (available but not on sale), listed tickets (on sale), sold tickets (tickets that are listed once, and not on sale right now), on sale (tickets someone is selling after listed once). This part is not constant since event owner will see + button if they did not mint any tickets yet. One can see the difference between event owner's view and an ordinary user's view at the end of the page.","Then, the page has Your Ticket status section. This part shows tickets you own or you are selling. Via refreshing it, one can see newly bought tickets. If one has a ticket, the right arrow button appers. This button redirects user to My Tickets page.","After that, we have the name of tickets and description of it. The important part here is price of tickets (or sold out part) here. Also, one can buy or view auctions through this section.","An event owner will see floating actions button on the right bottom section. The action button with people redirect you to Add Event Checker Page.","The checker will see the floating button with qr code will redirect you to Scan Page instead of add event checker page.","Ordinary user view:","Event owner view: Expired event page:"]}],[{"l":"Home Page","p":["Home page is default screen of Tickript. The log-in state does not affect what home page looks like. It can be accessed by clicking bottom navigation bar's first icon. The home page looks like:","The usage of home page is pretty simple. It has two parts:","Categories","Events"]},{"l":"Categories","p":["Categories part of the home page has a horizontal slider which shows all the categories of Tickript. There is 6 categories and all of them are clickable. If one goes that category's page, the one will be able to see tickets under that category."]},{"l":"Events","p":["Events part of the home page is an vertical slider which shows some of the events that are created in Tickript. The vertical slider does not show all the events that exists in Tickript."]}],[{"l":"Profile Page","p":["The aim of ours when creating a profile page to give opportunity to both event managers and ordinary users. Event managers should have been able to create events, mint tickets and sell them starting from their profile pages. Also, they should have been able to see their created events. On the other hand, ordinary users should have been able to see their own tickets. Also, all users should be able to login into application.","Profile page is fed from Profile Modal.","To reach our aims, we have created the profile page with 3 different states:","Logged out state","Logged in state","Settings"]},{"l":"Logged Out State","p":["The aim of logged out state to give opportunity to end user to login with Metamask. Logged out state has pretty simple structure. It just has a button to login to app. To see how login works, see Workflows.","The logged out state can be seen below:"]},{"l":"Logged In State","p":["There are more than one reason why we created logged in state. First, users should be able to reach their profile settings. Secondly, event owners should be able to create new events. Thirdly, ordinary users should be able to see their tickets (because of hiearchy, also event owners).","In the picture below, we see that there is button which redirects the end user to settings state. Here, a little difference comes: even though there is my events section, an ordinary user cannot see it. One should be event owner to see the part of My Events.","In the picture below, one can see that there is Attending section. Attending section is visible to users who own any ticket. Please note that if you are event owner and listed new tickets, the tickets will not be here. The attending section has two parts: tickets that is not outdated (event's start date is not passed), and outdated tickets."]},{"l":"Settings State","p":["Settings state should be able to provide changing the username and changing the profile picture. When one is an event owner, profile picture and username makes sense since others see who is organizing the event. However, for an ordinary user these are not important.","In the picture below, we see a clickable picture and text box with which an user can change its name:"]}],[{"l":"Search Page","p":["Search page is a simple search page in which there exists a text box. When user enters an input that has 3 or more characters, it shows events with matching or partially names.","Without input it looks like:","With input \"pool\", it looks like:"]}],[{"l":"Add Event Checker Page","p":["Add event checker page is the most simple therefore the most obvious page of the application. It has 1 text box in which the event owner should enter a public address and a button that submits the public address to add it to event checker list.","That is how it looks like:"]}],[{"l":"Auctions Page","p":["Auctions Page is accessible through an event's page. In this page with section Tickets on auction, one may bid to other auctions that are created by other users or see its own auctions.","An ordinary auctions page looks like:"]}],[{"l":"Bidding Page","p":["In a bidding page, an user sees event's image, when the auction will end, the start price or current price of the auction, placing bid section and total bids for this ticket. One can reclaim all the bids it has done in the last section of this page.","An ordinary bidding page looks like:"]}],[{"l":"Create Tickets Page","p":["Create Tickets Page is a type of minting page. The page has the event's informations in the beginning. After that, the amount of tickets that will be created (minted) is inputted.

However, in the tickets you own currently you may see the tickets that are in auction right now.","In the tickets you own part, you can click tickets and see a pop-up in which there is a button which redirects to QR Code Page. Also from this pop-up you can transfer your ticket, resell it and put it into auction. To see how they work, look at Usage.","In the tickets you are selling part, we see your tickets that are on sale. If you click one of them, you can stop it from selling it. If you stop sale all, you can stop saling of all.","Without popup, my tickets page looks like:","With popup of ticket clicked that is not on sale, it looks like:"]}],[{"l":"QR Code Page","p":["QR Code Page just includes a QR code to show event checkers. That is used when you want to enter an event.","One should not show its QR code to anyone, since it may result in others to use it.","An example of QR Code may look like:"]}],[{"l":"Scan Page","p":["You can reach to scan page if and only if you are an event checker of that event. After opening the scan page, one will see a camera, which helps you to read QR codes and a button which changes state of ticket to used. After reading a QR code, even though if event checker did not press finish control, one will not be able to pass (creates an error popup).","An event checker can reach this page and click to Finish Control button anytime it wants.","An ordinary scan page looks like:"]}],[{"l":"Selling Page","p":["Selling page only is visible when tickets will be sold first time. Therefore, only an event owner is able to see this page, and all the tickets will be affected by this operation.","In selling page, there is 3 inputs: transfer count (including resells), commission from every transfer, and price of the ticket.
