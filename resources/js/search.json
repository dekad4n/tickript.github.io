First, users should be able to reach their profile settings. Secondly, event owners should be able to create new events.

Here, a little difference comes: even though there is my events section, an ordinary user cannot see it. One should be event owner to see the part of My Events.","In the picture below, one can see that there is Attending section. Attending section is visible to users who own any ticket.
