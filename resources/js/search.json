To see what event modal looks like, see Event Modal.","Events are created with event creation process. Therefore, the event page is formed from actually event owner's inputs.","Event page has three forms: an ordinary user's view, checker's view, event owner's view. Ownership is automatically detected via states of mobile application, therefore the two forms are located in the same page.","An ordinary event page starts with picture of the event and title of it. They are located in the beginning of the page. The owner, the date and the description of the event follows the first part. These are all constant parts that does not change if an user is ordinary or event owner.","Then, there is a table in which minted tickets (available but not on sale), listed tickets (on sale), sold tickets (tickets that are listed once, and not on sale right now), on sale (tickets someone is selling after listed once). This part is not constant since event owner will see + button if they did not mint any tickets yet. One can see the difference between event owner's view and an ordinary user's view at the end of the page.","Then, the page has Your Ticket status section. This part shows tickets you own or you are selling. Via refreshing it, one can see newly bought tickets. If one has a ticket, the right arrow button appers. This button redirects user to My Tickets page.","After that, we have the name of tickets and description of it. The important part here is price of tickets (or sold out part) here.

Here, a little difference comes: even though there is my events section, an ordinary user cannot see it. One should be event owner to see the part of My Events.","In the picture below, one can see that there is Attending section. Attending section is visible to users who own any ticket. Please note that if you are event owner and listed new tickets, the tickets will not be here. The attending section has two parts: tickets that is not outdated (event's start date is not passed), and outdated tickets."]},{"l":"Settings State","p":["Settings state should be able to provide changing the username and changing the profile picture.
