# Bidding & Claiming
In every [Auction Page](/Pages/Subpages/createauction.md) (accessible through event page), there is a bidding option if the auction is now owned by you. To bid on the ticket, enter a price in the section of bidding and click on Place Bid button. Please note that your bid **should be higher** than the highest bid. After that, Metamask will be opened, and if it asks for your password enter it. Then, a popup will appear, scroll down until you see the confirm button an click it:

## Claiming (Withdrawing) Previous Bids
After you bid on an auction, if someone has higher bid than you or auction is ended, you should withdraw your bids back to get your money back. To do that go to [Auction Page](/Pages/Subpages/createauction.md). There will be a section in which you are able to see your total bid. Click on the claim button, Metamask will be opened, if it asks for your password enter it. Then, a popup will appear, scroll down until you see the confirm button, and click it:
