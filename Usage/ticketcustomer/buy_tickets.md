# Buying Tickets
To buy any ticket from an Event, go to Event's page. Then, scroll down until you see Buy button. If there is no such button, that means that event does not have any tickets that are on sale. Also, it can be seen in On Sale section. 

Click on the Buy Button. Metamask will be opened, if it asks for your password, enter it. Then you will be asked to sign a transaction with a cost. Cost appers on the top of the transaction. If you have enough MATIC, scroll down until you see the confirm button and click it:
