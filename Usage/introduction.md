# Introduction

Our main aim of the usage part of the documentation is to help end users to use the app. The part does not contain any technical detail.

In this part, you will see:
- Login & Profile
- Create Event
- Minting Tickets
- Selling Tickets
- Buying Tickets
- Auction
- Bidding

Every part contains just usage information and step-by-step introduction to that process.
