# Adding an Event Checker
To be able to scan QR codes of a ticket for a specific event, the event owner should add the user into event checker list. Even event owner should add itself to list to be able to check tickets.

If you are an event checker, you will see a QR code button under right-bottom. If you do not see that, ask your event owner to add you as event checker.

As an event owner, to add event checker go to your [Event Page](/Pages/mainpages/event.md). Then, click on the button with people in right-bottom. You will be redirected to [Add Event Checker Page](/Pages/Subpages/addeventchecker.md). 

Enter the user's public address which you want to add ass event checker. Then click onto confirm button. Metamask will be opened, enter your password if asked. Then, you will be prompted with signing a transaction. Scroll until you see confirm button and click it:
