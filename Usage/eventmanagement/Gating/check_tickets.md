# Checking & Scanning Tickets 
If you are an event checker, you should be able to scan QR codes of tickets. 

To check tickets, go to [Event Page](/Pages/mainpages/event.md) you want to check. Then, you should be able to see QR Code sign under right-bottom. If you do not see it, ask your event owner to add you as event checker with [Adding Event Checker](/Usage/eventmanagement/add_event_checker.md) process. Click on the button after you see it. 

You will be redirect to [Scan Page](/Pages/Subpages/scanpage.md). Here hold your camera through a QR Code that is generated by us. If the user is not shown its ticket to any event checker before, you will see green pop-up which means the customer is safe to pass. If you see red pop-up, do not let the customer to pass since the ticket is already used or checked.

After you finish scanning, tou can click on Finish Control **anytime you want**. After clicking it, Metamask will be opened, if it asks for your password enter it. Then, you will be requested for signing a transaction, scroll until you see confirm button, then click it:
