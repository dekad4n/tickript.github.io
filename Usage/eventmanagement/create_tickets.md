# Creating Tickets
To create tickets, you should have an existing event which is not expired (the start date did not pass). To see how you can create an event see [Creating an Event](/Usage/eventmanagement/create_event.md).

To create tickets for your event, go to event page from your [Profile Page](/Pages/mainpages/profile.md) via clicking the event's card in the My Events section. Then, you should be redirect to [Event Page](/Pages/mainpages/event.md). Here, click (+) button that is under the Minted section.

Now, you are in [Create Tickets Page](/Pages/Subpages/mint.md). Enter the quantity of tickets you want to create and click on confirm button. Metamask will be opened, if your password is asked enter it. You will be prompted for a transaction, scroll down the transaction details and press confirm in the screen below:

Please note that you **cannot** create tickets several times, since we wanted to block any unusual activities that is done by event owners.
